        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology/ Administrative Studies MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I, Jessica Arauz, am currently a first year at University of California, Riverside majoring in Sociology/ Administrative Studies. I am currently a member in two club organizations on-campus. The two organizations are UCR Salsa Club and The UCR Latino Business Student Association. In the UCR Salsa Club, we as members of the club are taught how to dance all sorts of latin dances ranging from bachata, salsa, etc. from dance instructors from dance studios. In the UCR Latino Business Student Association Organization, we learn how to dress properly in a business setting, structure our resumes, and how to stand out in interviews. As an organization, we use our free time to volunteer and contribute to our community. In the following school year, I plan to run for positions in the clubs and become a member of each board. <br><br>

        In high school, I was very involved in varsity sports, leadership club, National Honors Society Club, volunteering, and assisting soccer coaching at my local public park. I have experience from being involved in Leadership for 3 years. I developed many skills from working with others to make events happen around school. I was in the position of Chair in certain committees. As chair, I guided the committee members to successfully have school events that promote school spirit. While planning the events, I formatted flyers and banners with information on where the event was taking place with the time and date included. I used social media as a tool to post digital flyers and videos to encourage students to attend the events. I was also responsible for getting paperwork signed for approval as well as organizing all the paperwork of other events. I plan to use the skills I have attained and learn from my college clubs in future job positions. 
<br><br>
        The University of California, Riverside gave me the opportunity to study both sociology and business with my major which is a perfect fit for me. Once I graduate from the University of California, Riverside, I plan to continue my education and receive a Masters Degree in Education. My goal is to become a Guidance Counselor and a Business Owner. I plan to have a career as a Guidance Counselor because my own guidance counselor made a great impact on my educational path. I plan to use my degree to attain a job in the educational system as a guidance counselor and give the youth in my community more opportunities in their education where they too can reach their academic goals in spite of the life challenges they face.
